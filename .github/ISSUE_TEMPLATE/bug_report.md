<!--
If you're reporting a bug, please include as many details as possible! If you're able to provide a list of steps to reproduce the issue, even better.

Even seemingly benign actions like "swiped to second page of quick settings tiles" can make a huge difference. PixelLight has to do some nasty things to work around Android's limitations.
